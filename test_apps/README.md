Tutorial Simulation
===================
This is a very simple 'Tutorial' application. The intent is to help me get
familiar with how all of the pieces of the simulation fit together. Hopefully
it will help others who are starting out writing simulations.

The simulation creates a series of objects, and then passes a message around in
a ring. When the messages reaches the first node again the simulation ends.
